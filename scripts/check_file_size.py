"""Enforce a per-file line budget to keep modules focused and reviewable.

Run via `make lint-loc`. Fails (exit 1) if any tracked Python file exceeds the
soft cap, so a module that has grown too large gets split rather than sprawling.

VENDORED FILES ARE EXEMPT, AND THE EXEMPTION IS DERIVED
-------------------------------------------------------
The fleet conformance probes in ``tests/conformance/`` are vendored BYTE-IDENTICAL
from ``genefoundry-router``, which is their single source of truth. They are not ours
to split: splitting one would break the vendoring contract that makes every ``-link``
repo run the same gate, and the next sync would silently revert the split anyway.

The exemption is read from each file's OWN docstring ("vendored"), never from a
hardcoded list of filenames here. A hardcoded list is the same bug one level up:
whoever adds the next vendored probe forgets the list, the build breaks, and the fix
under time pressure is to shrink the budget's reach rather than the file. Derived
means a new vendored probe is exempt the day it lands, and a repo-authored file in the
same directory is still budgeted.
