"""Build-hardening guard (F-19): the builder must bootstrap ``uv`` from a
digest-pinned image via ``COPY --from`` rather than a floating
``pip install --upgrade pip uv``. Pinning the installer bootstrap removes a
supply-chain drift vector (an unpinned pip/uv upgrade resolves a new version on
every rebuild). Research use only; not clinical decision support."""
