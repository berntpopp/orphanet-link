## [Unreleased]

### Added

- MCP `_meta` now stamps `unsafe_for_clinical_use: True` on every tool response
  (success and error paths alike), at every `response_mode`. Previously the
  research-use disclaimer lived only in the static `get_server_capabilities`
  discovery payload; it is now emitted per-call so every response is
  self-describing, matching the fleet-wide disclaimer standardization decision.
